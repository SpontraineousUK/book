## What do you do in detail?

Spon**train**eous is a website that finds great value holiday destinations from any UK railway station within a budget using under-utilised off-peak trains and B&Bs. We offer UK customers beautiful UK destinations at prices beating lastminute.com's deals.

## What's different/interesting about Spon**train**eous?

We're a start-up encouraging the behemoth, entrenched, regulated train industry to adopt the seat-filling efficiency of the airlines. Because we're selling almost-free goods (seats that will travel empty anyway and bedrooms that will stand empty for the night) we anticipate being able to take a reasonable cut of the revenue generated by our service.

The wider benefits of allowing families, ramblers, cyclists and everyone else to spend their holidays in forgotten gems in the UK is to breathe new life into the British tourist economy with money that would otherwise be spent abroad.

## Have you validated the proposition with potential customers?

We did a survey of 20+ passengers on a mostly empty Saturday morning train from Sheffield to York. Nearly all were leisure travellers and all liked our proposition.

## How do your potential customers cope at the moment?

Most travel in the UK by National Express or Megabus. Or fly their holiday spending abroad to places like Marrakesh. 

The minority that do use rail must research the myriad of travelcard options then buy an off-peak ticket on-the-day at the station. This is complicated for them (eg knowing when to buy multiple tickets vs one through ticket if you change trains) but it also means that the train operating company has no seat reservations and no accurate picture about occupancy expected.


Organisations we're hoping will be supportive:

- GWR
- City of York
- Visit Britain
- Network Rail
- Other TOCs
- UK Rail Regulator

Things we need to create:

1. A database of unreserved seats and anticipated walk-up passenger numbers on each train. Or a database of numbers of seat reservations and their best price that TOCs want us to sell on each train.
2. Curated database of UK leisure destinations with stations, B&Bs, picutres and marketing text for each destination.
3. Integration with a UK rail ticketing provider.
4. The business model for discounting last-minute train tickets and seat reservations.
