          <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
          <p>
            Q: Why are your train tickets so cheap compared to what I can find online?
          </p>
          <p>
            A: These special deals are not available elsewhere because we are working with the train companies to sell off their "distressed inventory" - the seats that they cannot shift on off-peak trains that usually just run quite empty.
            We are able to tap into this unsold inventory to bring you such great prices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Q: When you say "75% off", what price are you comparing this to?
          </p>
          <p>
            A: The discount price is compared to the cheapest super-off-peak ticket price available online or at the station for the train and the list price of events and attractions included in the trip package.
          </p>
          <p>
            Q: If I wanted to save money, I just travel by coach instead. Why should I bother with Spontraineous?
          </p>
          <p>
            A: Of course you could, but traveling by train is so much more comfortable.
            We're not claiming to be the cheapest way to travel - we're bringing you a luxury product at a heavily discounted price.
          </p>
          <p>
            Q: I want to go to a destination that is not on your website, can you help me?
          </p>
          <p>
            A: I'm afraid we cannot at this stage.
            If there is somewhere which you think we definitely to run a trip to, then drop us a line and we'll look into it.
            We're always interested to hear from you and are open to suggestions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Q: I could get an airline ticket with a budget airline for a ridiculously cheap price to Sweden/Germany/etc.
            Why should I go on a Spontraineous break instead of flying abroad?
          </p>
          <p>
            A: By all means go ahead, but those super cheap flights usually leave an airport like Stansted or Luton at some ridiculous hour.
            You get what you pay for - consider the time and money you have to spend getting to and from the airport at both ends of your journey.
            Suddenly, it doesn't seem that cheap after all, does it?
          </p>
          <p>
            Q: What next for Spontraineous?
          </p>
          <p>
            A: We will be bringing you more destinations, with more train operating companies over the course of the year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Q: Why are you targeting university students, in particular foreign students?
          </p>
          <p>
            A: Foreign students seem a lot more keen on traveling around the UK when they are here on a 3 year student visa (or just 1 year for a masters degree), thus they have a greater sense of urgency to explore as many places as they can in the UK whenever they have the time.
            A local English student from Essex just doesn't have that same sense of urgency to visit Somerset or Devon as there's no 'deadline' as such.
          </p>
          <p>
            Q: How will my tickets be issued?
          </p>
          <p>
            A: When you book with us, you will receive a voucher along with an e-ticket for your train journey.
            The voucher will grant you access to the attraction when you arrive at your destination.
          </p>
          <p>
            Q: Are your Spontraineous trips guided? I don't want to get lost and miss my train.
          </p>
          <p>
            A: Your trips are not guided but when you book with us, you will receive a suggested itinerary that you can follow:
            This will include directions and suggestions as to where to go, where to eat, where to spend your time, how long it will take for you to get from the train station to various places.
            As long as you have that email on your phone, you don't have anything to worry about.
          </p>
          <p>
            Q: Where can I go on Spontraineous breaks?
          </p>
          <p>
            A: Spontraineous is working with the various local tourism promotion organisations to bring you the best destinations around the country - our local knowledge will bring you not just the more famous attractions, but also hidden gems that are somewhat off the beaten track but are truly amazing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Q: What if my train is delayed or canceled?
          </p>
          <p>
            A: Your ticket will be valid on the next available train or any alternative transport that the train operator arranges.
          </p>
          <p>
            Q: I have bought a ticket but can't make it now, can I make changes?
          </p>
          <p>
            A: No, tickets are non-refundable. However it is yours to sell or give to someone else to enjoy the trip.
